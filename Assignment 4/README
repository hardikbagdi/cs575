Just run 'make' and the command will compile the code and run it too.

Brute Force solution computes all possible sets and then selects the optimal solution.

Refined Dynamic programming solution is implemented using memoization concept. Hence the solution is recursive in nature and seems a normal dynamic programming solution but it calculates only the value needed and not all the values. Space complexity is same as a normal dynamic programming solution (the assignment guidliens allow this) but computational complexity is O(2^n) in worst case.

Backtracking solution uses the same approach in lecture notes with same variable names to ease implementation.
